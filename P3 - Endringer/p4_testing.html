        <h2>Test</h2>
        <p> A brief summary of the questionnaire you send out to testers, as
            well as the link to the Google Form you used. Don't forget to ask your client to test
            the website.

    <section>
        <h2>Bruker</h2>
        <p> A description of your efforts to reach testers that are similar to the
            website's intended audience and how successful you were (give the percentages of
            your tester audience once you aggregate their answers, e.g., 23% of college
            students, 46% school administrators, etc.) If you are collecting age-ranges, you can
            do the same. If you were able to do live testing with a few users, describe that as
            well.
        </p>

    <section>
        <h2>Brukerplattformer</h2>
        <p> A summary of the different platforms (devices and browsers) that
            your testers used.
        </p>

    <section>
        <h2>Feedback (sammendrag)</h2>
        <p> A summary of the feedback you received organized by
            question type (design, navigation, content, usability, etc.). Highlight both positive
            comments and thoughtful criticism, your client's testimonial, etc.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Respons</h2>
        <p> Provide your response to the feedback. Concretely, describe what
            you could do (once the class is over) to address this feedback with changes in your
            design or implementation. You can also address why some of the raised issues or
            suggestions for improvements are difficult or impossible to tackle.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Refleksjon rundt hele prosjektet</h2>
        <p> Step back and reflect on the whole project experience and what you
            learned from it. Are there general lessons that you learned, beyond the
            nuts-and-bolts of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript? We would like you to take this
            seriously and be thoughtful about your comments, but there is no right or wrong
            answer here, so don't feel that you have to flatter us or try to divine what we want to
            hear.
